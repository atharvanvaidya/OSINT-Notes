## > GeoSocial Footprint
A geosocial footprint is the combined bits of location information that a user divulges through social media, which ultimately forms the users location "footprint". For Twitter users, this footprint is created from GPS enabled tweets, social check-ins, natural language location searching (geocoding), and profile harvesting.
This website provides twitter users with an opportunity to view their geosocial footprint. In addition, it informs users of some potential areas of concern with their current sharing habits. To begin, enter your Twitter.com username in the input box below and press "Retrieve Tweets".

## > HTTrack 
It is a free (GPL, libre/free software) and easy-to-use offline browser utility.
It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system.

- #### Magictree
    MagicTree is a penetration tester productivity tool. It is designed to allow easy and straightforward data consolidation, querying, external command execution and (yeah!) report generation. In case you wonder, "Tree" is because all the data is stored in a tree structure, and "Magic" is because it is designed to magically do the most cumbersome and boring part of penetration testing - data management and reporting.

- ### Foca
    FOCA (Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives) is a tool used mainly to find metadata and hidden information in the documents it scans. These documents may be on web pages, and can be downloaded and analyzed with FOCA.

    It is capable of analyzing a wide variety of documents, with the most common being Microsoft Office, Open Office, or PDF files, although it also analyzes Adobe InDesign or SVG files, for instance.
    These documents are searched for using three possible search engines: Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. The sum of the results from the three engines amounts to a lot of documents. It is also possible to add local files to extract the EXIF information from graphic files, and a complete analysis of the information discovered through the URL is conducted even before downloading the file.

    With all data extracted from all files, FOCA matches information in an attempt to identify which documents have been created by the same team and what servers and clients may be infered from them.
